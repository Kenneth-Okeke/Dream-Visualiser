# Dream Visualizer

Dream Visualizer is a web application that transforms your dreams into visual artworks using artificial intelligence. By leveraging the power of [OpenAI's DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e), users can input text descriptions of their dreams and receive unique, AI-generated images. The application utilizes OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication, ensuring a safe and personalized experience.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Image Generation**: Convert descriptions of dreams into stunning images with DALL·E.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilize OAuth 2.0 for a secure login process.
- **User Gallery**: Explore and share visualized dreams within the community.
- **Privacy-Centric**: We are committed to user privacy and security.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up Dream Visualizer on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and accounts set up:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for macOS users): Package manager for installing Node.js and other dependencies.
- Accounts and API keys:
  - [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/): For implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication.
  - [OpenAI account](https://openai.com/): For access to the DALL·E API.

### Installing Homebrew (macOS)

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Homebrew (skip if already installed):
`bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

After installation, install Node.js using Homebrew:

bash
Copy code
brew install node
Setting Up the Project
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/dream-visualizer.git
cd dream-visualizer
Install dependencies with NPM

Ensure you are in the project directory, then run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root. Replace placeholder values with your actual API keys and credentials:

plaintext
Copy code
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=YourAuth0ClientId
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=YourAuth0ClientSecret
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://YourAuth0Domain
DALLE_API_KEY=YourDalleApiKey
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
Running the Application

Start the application with:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access it via http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
